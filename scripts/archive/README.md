# Archived scripts

Legacy shell helpers that predate the Go smoke suite are stored under this
folder for reference. The `smoke/` subdirectory contains the retired Bash-based
smoke test scripts so migrations can audit historical behaviour without keeping
them on the default execution path.

These scripts are no longer invoked by the Makefile or CI workflows. Prefer the
Go suite in [`test/smoke`](../../test/smoke) for ongoing coverage.
