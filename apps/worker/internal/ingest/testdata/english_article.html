      <h1>The Dawn of Readability Extraction</h1>
      <p>
        Modern knowledge workers spend countless hours sifting through cluttered web
        pages before they can reach the core ideas they seek. Readability algorithms
        help by stripping away visual noise so readers can focus on what matters.
        When typography, navigation, and ads fade into the background, comprehension
        improves and fatigue declines dramatically for teams that have to read all day.

        This demonstration article explains how a worker service can transform raw HTML
        into structured summaries with titles, bylines, and accurate word counts that
        power search, recommendation, and archival workflows across an organization.
        Engineers rely on these summaries to bootstrap indexes, researchers mine them
        for quotes, and executives depend on succinct reports for quick decisions.

        Beyond the basics, high quality extraction also records metadata about language
        detection, publication times, and content themes. Those signals feed analytics
        dashboards that reveal how information flows through a company. With every
        enriched document, the feedback loop between authors and readers becomes more
        insightful, ensuring that long-form writing maintains its place in modern work.
